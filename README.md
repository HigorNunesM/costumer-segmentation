# costumer-segmentation

In this project we implemented a costumer segmentation with a RFM analysis.

Using the clientâ€™s purchase history, we were able to generate the metrics for a RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency and Monetary).

With the metrics in hand we segmented the clients accordingly with their scores. This classification method is used to better understand the costumer habits and how to improve the company relationship with them. Having better ad campaigns towards them.

At the end I show 3 examples of clients that could have been better treated if we had their class beforehand.
